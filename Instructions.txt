	Shaped Form Template
		by VB Overlord

1. Place all of the other files in this ZIP in the VB\TEMPLATES\PROJECTS directory.
2. Start VB, and choose a new project. There should be a Shaped Form project. Open it.
3. VB will give you a blank white form. Now run some graphics program like Paint or Photoshop.
4. Create an image to use as your form shape. Keep in mind that any white pixels will become transparent.
5. Save the image, and load it into the form's Picture property.

NOTE: If you want to have a different background color, change the form's BackColor 
property and change the line in Form_Load that says "Transcolor = " to equal the 
SystemColorConstant of your transparent color.

The only drawback to this code is that you do not get a 3D border, as with a typical window.
If anyone can fix this, please let me know.
